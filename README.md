Overview

Ever wished that deploying your GitHub repo to a Hugging Face Space were as easy as pushing a commit? GitHub Repo to Spaces makes that dream a reality. By automating the synchronization process, this project lets you focus on writing brilliant code (or, at least, pretending to).

This tool is perfect for developers who:
   •   Want to instantly update their Spaces whenever code changes.
   •   Enjoy automation that removes manual deployment headaches.
   •   Appreciate a bit of humor in their documentation.

Features
   •   Automated Sync: Push updates from your GitHub repository directly to your Hugging Face Space.
   •   Seamless Integration: Works effortlessly with GitHub Actions for continuous deployment.
   •   Easy Configuration: Set up with minimal fuss—just provide your Hugging Face API token and your Space details.
   •   Lightweight and Fast: Designed to do one thing and do it well (with a dash of clever humor).

Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/canstralian/github-repo-to-spaces.git
cd github-repo-to-spaces
# Install dependencies (e.g., using pip if it's a Python project)
pip install -r requirements.txt

Tip: Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your machine.

Usage

Command-Line

Once installed, you can run the tool from the command line. For example:

python repo_to_spaces.py --repo YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL --space YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_SPACE_URL

This command will push the latest changes from your GitHub repository to your Hugging Face Space.

Manual Sync
	1.	Clone Your Repo: Ensure your repository is up-to-date.
	2.	Add Your Space as a Remote:

git remote add space https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_SPACE_NAME


	3.	Force Push:

git push --force space main



(Yes, sometimes force pushing is the secret ingredient—but use it wisely!)

Configuration

To enable seamless syncing, create a configuration file (e.g., config.yaml or use environment variables). You’ll need to specify:
   •   GitHub Repository URL
   •   Hugging Face Space URL
   •   Hugging Face API Token

Example (YAML):

github_repo: "https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO"
hf_space: "https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_SPACE"
hf_token: "your_huggingface_api_token_here"

Hint: For security, don’t hard-code your API token—use environment variables or GitHub Secrets when integrating with CI/CD.

GitHub Actions Integration

Automate your deployment with GitHub Actions. Create a workflow file (e.g., .github/workflows/sync-to-spaces.yml):

name: Sync to Hugging Face Space
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Sync to Hugging Face Space
        env:
          HF_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.HF_TOKEN }}
          HF_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.HF_USERNAME }}
          SPACE_NAME: ${{ secrets.SPACE_NAME }}
        run: |
          git remote add space https://$HF_USERNAME:$HF_TOKEN@huggingface.co/spaces/$HF_USERNAME/$SPACE_NAME
          git push --force space main

Replace the secret names with your own. This action will trigger on every push to the main branch and keep your Space updated automatically.
